## Junjie: Note
- I would like to use this repository as a place that we can share our ideas and thoughts. 
- I found we have so many things and so many ideas we can try but we have very limited time and resources so it's good to connect multiple ideas but we can sit down and discuss and we prioritize which ideas is most interesting and most valuable.
- So each different idea we can use a separate Markdown file to record anything under that file. We can also modify the same Markdown file to discuss.
